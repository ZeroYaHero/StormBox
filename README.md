Storm Box is gamemode created in Fortnite's UGC Ecosystem with Epic Game's Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and it's respective scripting language, Verse.<br/>
All code, models, textures, logos, etc is designed by @ZeroYaHero (me), anything not created by me is created by Epic Games and offered to creators to use as seen in their EULA and Rules:<br/>

Storm Box derives from gamemodes already popular with the general combat engaged playerbase.<br/> 
- One half of Storm Box originates from a mode where players enjoy combat in an enclosed-small-indestructible box with materials to build (Box fights). 
- The other half takes from Zone Wars, a gamemode that essentially takes the Storm/Zone mechanic from traditional Battle Royales (BR) that are used to force players into combat engagement, but in a much faster pace, omitting the "looting" period of a game.
Storm Box makes that enclosed-small-indestructible box function the same as the Storm/Zone mechanic seen in BR and Zone Wars.

Storm Box can be played following the directions seen here:
